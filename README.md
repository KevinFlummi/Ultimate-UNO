PURPOSE
=======
This version of UNO Extreme is extended and edited to improve the fun for all players. Some new cards were added and the basic rules were changed. Also, the complete rules are written in german and most of the newly added cards are based on german inside jokes, so feel free to learn german to enjoy this game.
